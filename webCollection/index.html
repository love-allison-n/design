  <span>
    <img src="img/blog.png" alt="travel blog"/>
    <div>
      <p>I created this website so that some of my close family and friends could
        see what I was up to while abroad on a 5 month long trip. It includes a
        journal, pictures, a bucket list, and some things I lerned on the way.</p>

  <h3>The Art of Hair Dye</h3>
  <span>
    <img src="img/dye.png" alt="the art of hair dye"/>
    <div>
    <p>This was a school project I did for my first Interactive Media class. The focus was on
      creating an asthetically pleasing website about the past, present, and future of an art
      medium. This was my introduction to responsive web design.</p>

  <h3>The Art of Collaboration</h3>
  <span>
    <img src="img/art.png" alt="artcollab"/>
    <div>
    <p>This was the final project for my second Interactive Media class. It is
      essencially a wireframe of a website I came up with to bring art to kids
      through the internet. It would allow them to share projects and ideas as
      well as draw directly on electronic devices. Though I was unable to attend,
      I was accepted as a panelist to talk about this project at the 2017
      International Symposium on Electronic Art.</p>

      Some of the projects are listed here as well, but it has more examples of
      what I've learned to do with HTML5, CSS3, and javascript.

      <h1>The Other Side of the World</h1>
      <p>How am I getting to New Zealand? Hawaiian Airlines. So here I am, in Honolulu, briefly
        breathing Hawaiian air. Though my layover is only three hours, and I don’t get to
        leave the airport, half the airport is outdoors. So I caught a glimpse of the mountains
        while moving between terminals, and I saw the deep blue waves while flying overhead, and I
        can feel how warm the air is. It’s not enough to even say I’ve had a taste, but this isn’t
        over Hawaii. I’ll be back.</p>
      <p>Three hours is plenty of time, however, to consider what I’ve gotten myself into. I’m
        moving to the other side of the world without plans for where to live or where to work. I
        have a hostel booked in the heart of Auckland for seven nights, and after that, I’m making it up
        as I go. I’ve been mentally preparing for a while; hopefully I’m ready to put myself out
        there.</p>

      <h1>Feet on Solid Ground</h1>
      <p>It’s been seven days (not including the day I lost on the way here),
        and I think I am finally getting the hang of things. At least I hope I
        don’t stick out like a soar thumb.</p>
      <p>Apparently, I don’t sound out of place. One of the realtors I spoke
        with this week and the desk clerk at the hostel were surprised when I
        said I am from California and said I don’t have a very strong accent.
        The desk clerk even said he would have guessed I was from New Zealand.
        I’m still trying to figure out why I think Kiwis sound different if they
        don’t think I sound different, but I’ll take it.</p>
      <p>The money system here is pretty easy to get used to. The paper money is
        gorgeous. It comes in three different bright colors: orange, blue, and
        green; and depicts the cute animals that are native to New Zealand as
        well as important political figures. On each there is a small spot of
        transparent material so you can actually see right through the money.
        The coins range from 5 cent pieces to 2 dollar pieces. So when the price
        tag says $19.99, you are not getting that cent back. But the best part
        about the way people buy and sell in New Zealand is that tax is included
        in the prices. It doesn’t feel like being taxed at all.</p>
      <p>I’ve learned that it’s very expensive to live in Auckland. The
        population is rising rapidly, and most of the buildings are new or
        updated. Not only is rent really high, but clothing, food, and
        entertainment are all more expensive in the center of the city than in
        more rural areas.  I’ll be staying in a boarding house in a quiet
        neighborhood with eight other flatmates about an hour from the city by
        bus. It’s far enough that I can afford it for a while, but close enough
        that I can get to the city whenever I want to. Someone I spoke to at the
        library mentioned that the big suburb near the boarding house is
        considered the bad part of Auckland. I laughed when I saw the area. It
        looked beautiful quiet and friendly to me.</p>
      <p>I’ve applied to so many job that all of Auckland must know I’ve
        arrived. I’ve few employers have gotten back to me, and after sifting
        through the offers that didn’t sound at all interesting or fun, I’ll be
        taking a job decorating commercial areas for the holidays. I’ll be low
        stress and entertaining. I can’t wait to find out what holiday
        decorations look like in a country where the holidays happen in the
        summer.</p>
      <p>The people in Auckland are so kind. It seems part of the language is to
        talk with a smile. Almost every person you pass on the street will say
        “heya,” or “mornin’.” Conversation seems to still be more prominent here
        than the phone huddling that goes on at home. If they get a chance
        they’ll tell you about whatever they’re excited about at the moment.</p>
      <p>The accent is cutest on the kids. At the library I heard a girl and her
        mother singing a version of The Itsy Bitsy Spider that I had never heard
        before. In the accent they sang, “The itsy bitsy spider went up the
        water spout, down came the snow and clogged up the top.” I guess it
        really wouldn’t make sense for those to be the lyrics in California.</p>
      <p>I'm excited to see more of what Auckland has to offer. But for now, I
        feel like I'm standing on solid ground and things are pulling together
        around me.</p>

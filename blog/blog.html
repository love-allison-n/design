    <h1>The Other Side of the World</h1>
    <p>How am I getting to New Zealand? Hawaiian Airlines. So here I am, in
      Honolulu, briefly breathing real Hawaiian air. My layover is only three
      hours, and I don’t get to leave the airport. However, half the airport is
      outdoors, so I caught a glimpse of the mountains while moving between
      terminals, and I saw the deep blue waves while flying overhead, and I can
      feel how warm the air is. It’s not enough to even say I’ve had a taste,
      but this isn’t over Hawaii. I’ll be back.</p>
    <p>Three hours is plenty of time, though, to consider what I’ve gotten
      myself into. I’m moving to a County I’ve never been to with no plans for
      where to live or where to work. I have a hostel booked in the heart of
      Auckland for seven nights, and after that, I’m making it up as I go. I’ve
      been mentally preparing for a while; hopefully I’m ready to put myself out
      there.</p>

      <h1>The Definition of a City</h1>
      <p>Being in Sydney has been wonderful. The city is full of life, energy,
        and art. The fashion game in Sydney is too strong, and I had to think
        about my bank account to keep myself from buying a whole new wardrobe
        (or two). Good food is everywhere. There are a millions things to do.
        Whether people have business or are just having fun, everyone has
        somewhere to be and something to be doing. Sydney is a truly vibrant
        city, and has shed some perspective on my time in New Zealand.</p>
      <p>I grew up in an urban environment. The Bay Area is alive with the
        hustle and bustle of people living their lives. I thought I knew what
        made a city a city. I thought a city was a dense collection of people in
        a relatively small geographical area. And of course, to accommodate
        those people, structures start to form vertically, transportation
        becomes systematic, and entertainment is everywhere. Now I’ve learned,
        while all cities are dense collections of people, not all dense
        collections of people are really cities.</p>
      <p>Auckland is confusing. It is a dense collection of people, and it has
        the buildings and infrastructure that come with it, but it’s missing
        something. One Million people live in Auckland. Though that may not seem
        like much, it’s one quarter of New Zealand’s entire population. When I
        arrived in Auckland, everything was new and exciting, but everyone I
        spoke to seemed bored. They insisted that they didn’t know what to do,
        or that Auckland didn’t have enough to do. As far as I could tell,
        however, there were plenty of things to do if you looked.</p>
      <p>Everyone in New Zealand is very proud of the “laid back” nature of the
        people there. The people are extremely kind and helpful, and you feel
        safe knowing that the people rarely have a malicious thought. But
        another part of the people being so “laid back,” is that they wander
        through life following the path of least resistance. While I’m all for
        going with the flow, it seems like many of the people in Auckland lack
        big dreams and goals to drive them forward. The only times I’ve felt
        real passion from Kiwis is when they talk about rugby. As I applied for
        jobs and housing in Auckland, it took forever to hear back from people
        or get anything done. I think it’s less that there is nothing to do in
        Auckland and more that people don’t want find things to do, or they have
        no one to do things with.</p>
      <p>The difference is in the people. A true city, or at least a good one,
        is a dense collection of people who care about something. Sydney is full
        of people who care about something. People were advocating for equal
        marriage rights. Artists have made their marks all over the city. People
        dressed with dedication and walked around in hundreds celebrating
        Oktoberfest. Even if it is just the dedication with which many of the
        local shops decorated for Halloween, the people in Sydney do things like
        they mean it; they walk with a purpose.</p>
      <p>I’ll have to remember, while I’m in New Zealand, to saver the
        relaxation and enjoy some down time between my own adventures. But I am
        happy that when I come home, I’ll be coming home to a place full of
        passion and energy.</p>
